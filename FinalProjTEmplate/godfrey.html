        <h1>The First Elden Lord</h1>
        <p>First husband to the goddess Marika of the lands between, Godfrey has been around a very long while. You spend most of the game hearing legends of the first elden lord that he becomes nothing but a distant myth by the end of it. So when you come face to face with this legendary warrior at the end of the game it is a very welcome surprise to say the least. Similar to Margit this boss has one of the most learnable attack patterns in the game on top of having incredibly fast paced movements. This bosses first phase is incredibly fun to master, but come second phase he will be out for vengance. His second phase attacks come with massive build in delays to trick specifically seasoned players into dodging early and getting caught. Not only does he do this, but he also throws his battle axe away in exchange for his bare fists. The ultimate badass of the game, Godfrey does not dissapoint in his showdown.</p>
