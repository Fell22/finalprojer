        <h1>The Undefeated Swordswoman</h1>
        <p>They dont call her that for nothing. Malenia is hands down the hardest boss in any game out there. Even incredibly seasoned veterens to the souls games have been known to take upwards of 11 hours to defeat this boss and for good reasons. Her attacks are faster, stronger, harder to read, and tougher to avoid than any other boss in the game. Beyond that, she has a gimmick attack known as the Waterfowls Dance. Infamously referred to as the "flurry attack" this gimmick is nearly impossible to avoid if you don't know exactly what you're looking for. And that isn't even the final kicker, not only does she have the same amount of health as the tankiest bosses in the game AND two healthbars making percent based damage not as effective, but every time she hits you she heals for as much damage as she does. In order to take down the Undefeated Swordswoman you need to perfectly against the hardest enemy in the game for a very long period of time. Conquering Malenia is truly an achievemnet you can be proud of.  </p>
